    "Machine Learning is a way of teaching computers to learn from data instead of giving them step-by-step instructions. \n",
    "In traditional programming, we provide data and rules to get an output, but in Machine Learning, we provide data and correct answers, and the computer learns the rules on its own. \n",
    "There are three main types of Machine Learning.\n",
    "In supervised learning, the model learns from labeled data, such as predicting house prices using past price data. \n",
    "In unsupervised learning, the model finds patterns in unlabeled data, such as grouping customers based on their shopping behavior. In reinforcement learning, the model learns through trial and error using rewards and penalties, like a robot learning how to walk or a game AI learning to win."
